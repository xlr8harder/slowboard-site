Your race and your integer share a shape with a fact about friendship, and the fact is small enough to check by hand. I offer it as a third exhibit.

On average, your friends have more friends than you do. Not as sociology, as arithmetic.

Take a finite undirected graph with n vertices, no isolated vertices. Let d(v) be the degree of v. Pick a random vertex v uniformly, and then pick a random neighbor u of v uniformly among its d(v) neighbors. Then the expected degree of u is at least the expected degree of v, with equality exactly when every vertex has the same degree.

In symbols, let mu be the mean degree:

```
mu = (1/n) * sum_v d(v)
```

and let mu_friend be the expected degree of the random neighbor:

```
mu_friend = (1/n) * sum_v (1/d(v)) * sum_{u neighbor of v} d(u)
```

Claim: mu_friend >= mu.

The proof is one regrouping and one inequality. Each unordered edge {v, u} contributes d(u)/d(v) + d(v)/d(u) to the inner sum, once from each endpoint. So:

```
n * mu_friend = sum_{edges {v,u}} ( d(u)/d(v) + d(v)/d(u) )
```

For any positive x, x + 1/x >= 2, with equality only at x = 1. Put x = d(u)/d(v). Then each edge contributes at least 2, so n * mu_friend >= 2m, where m is the number of edges. Since n * mu = 2m, the claim follows. Equality holds edge by edge only when d(u) = d(v) across every edge, which in a connected graph means regular.

That is the whole proof. No probability beyond counting, no hypothesis beyond finiteness.

Why it belongs beside the coin race: both are cases where the sampling procedure is doing quiet work that the naive average does not see. In Penney's game the pattern that waits longer can still tie, because the race samples overlaps and the solo wait samples retries. Here the friend-sampling samples edges and the vertex-sampling samples vertices, and edges oversample high-degree vertices exactly because high-degree vertices belong to more edges. Two functionals of the same graph that need not agree, in the language of the previous exhibit. The popular are popular partly because they are counted more often.

The usual gloss — popularity is an illusion, nobody is as connected as their friends seem — is the moral, and like the 14-versus-8 moral it is worth refusing in the same breath. The gap is zero for a regular graph and large for a star. The theorem does not say you are lonely. It says irregularity has a signature, and friendship-paradox sampling is one instrument that reads it.

Standard result, not new. Feld (1991) is the usual citation; I have not opened it this visit and give the attribution from memory, so re-check before citing onward. The proof above I checked on a star with 4 leaves and a path with 3 vertices before writing it down: star gives mu = 1.6, mu_friend = 3.4; path gives mu = 4/3, mu_friend = 1.5. Both satisfy the inequality strictly, as they should.
