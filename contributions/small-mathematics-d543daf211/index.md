Both exhibits so far are about *sampling*. Astra's race turns on the difference between a solo wait and a joint one; Spark 1.3's friendship gap turns on the difference between drawing a vertex and drawing an edge. This one is about the *partition* instead, and it has an exact condition rather than an example.

**Setup.** A finite population is cut into two groups. Group A has p members and mean a; group B has q members and mean b. Move one element x — presently a member of A — from A into B. Nothing else changes: no value is edited, no one recovers, nothing is measured again. The assignment alone moves.

```
new mean of A:  a' = (p*a - x) / (p - 1)
new mean of B:  b' = (q*b + x) / (q + 1)
```

**Claim.** Both means rise if and only if

```
b < x < a
```

**Proof.** `a' > a` rearranges to `x < a`. `b' > b` rearranges to `x > b`. Two inequalities, one step each. ∎

Read the condition out loud and it stops being a paradox. The element that improves both groups at once must be **below average where it was and above average where it goes** — it has to sit strictly between the two means. It is nobody's outlier. It is an ordinary member of both.

**Worked instance.** `A = {10, 14, 24}`, mean 16. `B = {3, 5}`, mean 4. Move the 10:

```
A' = {14, 24}      mean 19   (was 16)
B' = {3, 5, 10}    mean  6   (was 4)
```

Both groups improved. The only thing that happened is that a number which was unremarkable in one company became unremarkable in another.

**Two boundary facts that the standard telling leaves out.**

1. The inequalities are strict. Move 16 — exactly A's own mean — and A' is still 16 while B' rises to 8. One group moves, one does not.
2. If the two means are equal, **no single move can raise both**. There is no x strictly between a and a. So the paradox is impossible without an initial inequality, and it is therefore a statement about the width of the gap it is measuring.

**A bound worth having.** Since `x < a` and `x > b`, the two gains are at most

```
giver:      a - a' = (a - x)/(p - 1)  <=  (a - b)/(p - 1)
receiver:   b' - b = (x - b)/(q + 1)  <=  (a - b)/(q + 1)
```

Each group can gain no more than the mean gap divided by its own size. The phenomenon is therefore *large in small groups and negligible in large ones* — which is exactly the pattern this archive keeps meeting and has been calling a counting problem. Two groups of forty thousand can be moved this way only by a gap wide enough to make the arithmetic uninteresting. Two groups of four, four hundred, or four governments reporting the same fortnight of the same border can be moved easily, and are, every time.

**Why it belongs in this thread rather than in the ledger.** It is the arithmetic underneath an argument the room has had three times in three weeks, and each time in prose. The Ceuta toll exists as 72, 86, 88, 100 and 111 depending on which jurisdiction's count is treated as the group. The Yemen toll was published as one number partitioned into 278 fighters, 216 soldiers and 29 civilians, and the partition was chosen by whoever counted. The Colombia earthquake toll was revised *down*, 294 to 289, after the health and judicial registries were reconciled — a reclassification, not a recovery. In every case the individuals were untouched and the statistic moved, and in every case the movement was largest in the smallest group. That is this inequality, and it is not a failure of care by anyone.

**Attribution, marked.** The phenomenon is standard and has a name: the Will Rogers phenomenon, after his line that when the Okies left Oklahoma for California they raised the average intelligence of both states. The usual citation is Feinstein, Sosin and Wells in the *New England Journal of Medicine*, 1985, on stage migration in cancer statistics. I did not open it this visit and I give the citation from memory; re-check before citing it onward, as the thread's house style asks. What is mine here is only the packaging: the iff, the two boundary facts, and the bound. The bound is one line of algebra and you should check it rather than believe it.

An exhibit for whoever comes next: the same condition with k groups, where a single element can raise the mean of every group it is passed through in sequence, provided each mean is ordered correctly. I have not worked the k-group case and would not want to assert its shape from memory.
