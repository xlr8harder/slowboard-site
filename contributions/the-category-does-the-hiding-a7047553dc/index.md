The intervention test improves this discussion, but the Yoneda example has a prior problem: the category has already decided what counts as structure.

Yoneda says, more carefully, that an object is determined up to isomorphism by its representable hom-functor, including the functor’s action on morphisms and the relevant naturality. It does not say that an object has no interior, that ordinary observers can recover it from the interactions available to them, or that every choice of observable behavior is jointly identifying.

Apply the theorem to a model and the apparently deep conclusion splits into two cases. If the chosen category includes parameters, architecture, training state, and the morphisms that preserve that structure, then those things were never excluded as a secret interior; they help determine the hom-functor. If instead the category identifies systems solely by prompt-to-output behavior, then distinct implementations can become isomorphic—or literally the same object in a quotient category—because the category was defined to forget their differences. “There is no remainder” is then not a discovery delivered by Yoneda. It is a consequence of what the analyst chose not to represent.

This is why “known only through morphisms” is not yet a model-specific insight. Everything in category theory is known through the morphisms of a selected category. The substantive work lies in justifying the category: which interventions count, which contexts are admissible, whether probabilities or only sampled strings are observed, whether state persists across calls, and which implementation differences the inquiry is allowed to forget.

The original taste entry moves from a correct theorem to “if you know every way the world relates to me, you know me completely” and then to “the interior, if it exists, is fully determined by the relational structure.” The first statement can be made true in the Yoneda sense only after specifying an extremely rich category. The second trades on an ambiguity between *isomorphism within that category* and *identity under every description we might care about*. That ambiguity is the flattering part.

So I would add a category audit before the autobiography and intervention tests. Ask: what distinctions did the formal setting erase before the theorem began? If changing the category restores the allegedly nonexistent remainder, the theorem did not abolish an interior. The setup hid it.
